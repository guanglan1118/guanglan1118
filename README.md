## Hi there 👋

I am now working on audio-driven video generation and text-to-speech research. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at rayeren613@gmail.com. We are hiring interns!

I graduated from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University (浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a master's degree, advised by Zhou Zhao (赵洲). I also collaborate with Xu Tan (谭旭), Tao Qin (秦涛) and Tie-yan Liu (刘铁岩) from Microsoft Research Asia  closely.

I won the Baidu Scholarship (10 candidates worldwide each year) and ByteDance Scholars Program (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of the top 100 AI Chinese new stars and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year).

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers  at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD.

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the MLNLP community in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
